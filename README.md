# Front-end developer / designer worksim

This boilerplate is designed to help you start with the development task. Please fork this repo and work on your own copy of it.

Feel free to modify these files to suit your workflow.

At the end of your worksim please commit any changes to your local fork and share the URL with us.

## Project structure

We prepared `index.php` with basic HTML5 structure and `assets` folder where you can keep your scripts, styles and images.

We also included `Gruntfile.js` with basic [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) tasks so you can compile your [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) assets.

**Instructions on setting up Grunt and Bower:**

1. If you are unfamiliar with npm and donâ€™t have node.js installed, [download](http://nodejs.org/download/) it first.
2. Then from them command line:
  - Install `grunt-cli` and `bower` globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli bower`.
  - Navigate to the vendor folder in your theme directory and run `npm install`. npm will look at `package.json` and automatically install the necessary dependencies. It will also automatically install front-end packages defined in `bower.json`.
